Linux introduction
Linux Introduction Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It’s a free and flexible alternative to proprietary operating systems like Windows and macOS. Linux is widely used in various devices, from supercomputers to embedded systems,

why Linux is so popular Open-source:
OPEN-SOURCE: Linux code is freely available and modifiable by anyone.

CUSTOMIZABLE: Users can tailor Linux to their needs by modifying the code or installing different distributions (distros).

SECURE: Linux is considered a secure OS due to its open-source nature, allowing developers to identify and fix vulnerabilities quickly.

PORTABLE: Linux can run on a wide range of hardware platforms, from desktops to mobile devices.

What are the Key components Kernel:
KERNEL: The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system, responsible for managing hardware resources and providing services to applications.

SYSTEM LIBRARIES: These libraries provide pre-written code for common tasks, such as file I/O and networking.

SHELL: The shell (e.g., Bash) is the command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the system, execute commands, and run applications.

DISTRIBUTIONS: Linux distributions (distros) are customized versions of the Linux kernel and system libraries, Popular distros include Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and Arch Linux.

What are the Benifits of Linux
Free: Linux is free to download and use, with no licensing fees.

Customizable: Users can tailor Linux to their needs by modifying the code or installing different distros.

Secure: Linux is considered a secure OS due to its open-source nature.

Flexible: Linux can run on a wide range of hardware platforms and is suitable for various use cases, from desktops to servers and embedded systems.

Common linux uses Servers:
Servers: Linux is widely used as a server OS, powering web servers, databases, and email servers.

Desktops: Linux is a popular choice for desktop operating systems, offering a free and customizable alternative to proprietary OSes.

Embedded Systems: Linux is used in various embedded devices, such as routers, set-top boxes, and automotive systems.

Supercomputers: Linux is used in many of the world’s fastest supercomputers, due to its scalability and customizability.

Getting Started Choose a Distribution:
Select a Linux distro that fits your needs and skill level.

Install: Download and install the chosen distro on your hardware.

Explore: Familiarize yourself with the Linux command-line interface (CLI) & basic commands.

Learn: Take online courses or tutorials to deepen your understanding of Linux and its various components.
